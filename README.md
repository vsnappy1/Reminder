# Reminder
I have developed a native Android app that demonstrates my proficiency in several key areas of Android development. The app was built using **Kotlin**, which allowed me to leverage its concise syntax and powerful features. To provide a modern and engaging user interface, I used **Jetpack Compose**, a declarative UI toolkit that enabled me to create custom UI components with ease.


To ensure that the app follows a scalable and maintainable architecture, I implemented the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** pattern. This allowed me to separate the concerns of the app and make it easier to test and extend.


In addition to the above, I have also implemented **Animations** that enhance the user experience and create a more fluid and engaging interface. To store data locally, I used **Room Database**, a powerful ORM that allowed me to interact with the database using simple queries.


To keep users informed and engaged, I implemented **Notifications** that are triggered by various events within the app. These notifications provide users with relevant information and encourage them to return to the app.


Overall, my app demonstrates my expertise in Android development and showcases my ability to build **robust, scalable, and engaging apps** using the **latest technologies and best practices**.
